            //assignment url: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors#introduction

            inputs from user and outputus are through the console

            The console prompts the user to pick Rock Paper or Scissors
                - Use prompt()
            The user can enter: Rock, Paper, or Scissors
                - Case insensitive (user can enter rock, Rock, ROCK, roCk)
                - If the user enters something else, give an error
            The computer randomly picks rock paper or scissors

            if the user picks rock
                and the computer picks rock -> Output is 'That's a tie! You both picked rock!''
                and the computer picks paper -> Output is 'You lose! Paper beats rock!'
                and the computer picks scissors - > Output is 'You win! Rock beats scissors!'

            if the user picks scissors
                and the computer picks scissors -> Output is 'That's a tie! You both picked scissors!''
                and the computer picks paper -> Output is 'You win! Scissors beats paper!'
                and the computer picks rock - > Output is 'You lose! Rock beats scissors!'

            if the user picks paper
                and the computer picks paper -> Output is 'That's a tie! You both picked paper!''
                and the computer picks scissors -> Output is 'You lose! Scissors beats paper!'
                and the computer picks rock - > Output is 'You win! Rock beats scissors!'

            Output how many games the user has won, lost, and tied out of 5 games.
             
            Repeat the above until
          
            When 5 games have been played, 
                If there was a tie, output 'It's a tie! We're all winners!' OR
                if the computer or the user has more wins, output: '(Winner) wins!'
